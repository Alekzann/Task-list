# Task-list

## Description
In my task list, you can insert the task you need to do, then you click "Dodaj zadanie" and the task appears in the list below.
You can also click the " Done" button to mark the task as done, or the "Delete" button to remove the task from the list.
(Edit)
Added the possibility to mark all tasks as "completed" by clicking only one button "Ukończ wszystkie", you can also hide all completed tasks by clicking the button "Ukryj ukończone".

## How it works you will see below
